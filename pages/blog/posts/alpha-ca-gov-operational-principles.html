<p>Our operational principles guide how our team works.</p>

<p>They reflect our collaborative culture. And they inform our priority setting and decision making. These principles will inform our day-to-day work and big-picture planning.</p>

<p>Continuing our practice of building on what’s been tried and proven before, we’ve adopted and adapted the U.S. Digital Service principles.</p>

<p>We’ve made one adaptation. We added “Emphasize collaboration across teams” because collaboration is central and essential to our work.</p>

<p>This is how the Alpha Team works:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Default to open</li>
    <li>Understand what people need</li>
    <li>Use data to drive decisions</li>
    <li>Address the whole experience, from start to finish</li>
    <li>Make it simple and intuitive</li>
    <li>Build the service using agile and iterative practices</li>
    <li>Assign one leader and hold that person accountable</li>
    <li>Bring in experienced teams</li>
    <li>Emphasize collaboration across teams</li>
    <li>Structure budgets and contracts to support delivery</li>
    <li>Choose a modern technology stack</li>
    <li>Deploy in a flexible hosting environment</li>
    <li>Automate testing and deployments</li>
    <li>Manage security and privacy through reusable processes</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll continue to iterate and refine these principles as we learn by doing.</p>

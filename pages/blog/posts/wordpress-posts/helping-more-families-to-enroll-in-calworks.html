<p>California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) is a major safety net program. A recent study estimated 40% of eligible families are not enrolled in CalWORKs. The Office of Data and Innovation (ODI) worked with the Department of Social Services to explore enrollment barriers.</p>

<p>We learned that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduced burdens will improve enrollment and retention</li>

<li>Burdens to applicants and enrollees are also burdens to county staff</li>

<li>Communication to applicants and enrollees needs to be more clear, timely, and streamlined</li>

<li>Simpler policy guidance to counties would ease administrative burden</li>
</ul>

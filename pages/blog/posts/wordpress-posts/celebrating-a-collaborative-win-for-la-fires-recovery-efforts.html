<p>We’re proud to share that the Office of Data and Innovation (ODI), in partnership with the California Department of Technology (CDT), received the 2025 California CIO IT Team Leadership Award on April 16.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The recognition, at the 2025 California Public Sector CIO Academy, celebrates the state’s efforts in building a rapid response website for survivors and anyone impacted by the January 2025 LA fires.</p>

<p>“This honor reflects the strength of our long-standing collaboration with CDT and our shared commitment to supporting Californians through human-centered design and innovation,” said ODI Director Jeffery Marino. “Together, our teams built something that made a difference when it mattered most.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why it matters</h2>

<p>In the aftermath of the devastating LA fires, Californians needed timely, clear, and accessible information to help them begin the long journey of recovery. While managing trauma, uncertainty and loss, survivors, displaced individuals, and business owners were struggling to find support, resources, and guidance.</p>

<p>Our combined goal was to create a digital platform that could meet those needs quickly, clearly, and with compassion.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we built together</h2>

<p>Together with CDT, ODI built and launched a fire recovery website, <a href="https://www.ca.gov/lafires/">ca.gov/lafires</a>, to serve as a one-stop hub for survivor support. The site connected users to essential services like replacing documents, accessing aid, and getting permits to rebuild.</p>

<p>The site was designed using trauma-informed principles, is written to meet the state’s <a href="https://hub.innovation.ca.gov/content-design/plain-language-equity-standard/">plain language standard</a>, and has been shaped by input from survivors and field responders. Within the first month, over 50 improvements were made based on real-time feedback, including a new recovery service finder and digital dashboard tracking process.</p>

<p>This effort went beyond technology. It was about meeting the urgent needs of the fire survivors, working together with speed and care, and showing up for Californians in crisis.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Making an impact</h2>

<p>The site has since been visited over 750,000 times and continues to serve as a vital recovery source. The work reflects ODI and CDT’s shared commitment to Californians and to continue building better digital services.</p>

<p>We’re also proud to celebrate three individual IT Leadership award recipients:</p>

<p>Thea Man, ODI Chief Information Security Officer, was recognized for her proficiency and expertise in cybersecurity and fostering a culture of security across teams.</p>

<p>“This IT Leadership Award in Cybersecurity reflects our collective effort. The recognition is as much yours as it is mine. Together, we make ODI and the state safer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ian Rose, ODI’s Principal Data Engineer, was recognized for his leadership in accelerating the state’s adoption of modern cloud-based data tools through ODI’s Modern Data Stack Accelerator.</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful to be part of such a dedicated team working to improve the State’s data usage so we can solve tough problems and better serve Californians.”</p>

<p>Yesenia Aparicio, ODI’s Product Manager, was recognized for her expert product management of ODI’s many workstreams to support the LA fires response and recovery.</p>

<p>“It fills me with gratitude to receive this award, especially knowing it comes from serving the community that shaped me – my hometown, LA. This recognition isn&#8217;t mine alone: it belongs to the incredible all-star team I had the privilege of working alongside. Our team worked through a time that demanded action through the lens of human empathy and understanding. I am humbled and proud of each person who poured their heart into this effort. We&#8217;ve established a foundation we can build upon to ensure people have access to State services should a crisis happen again.”</p>

<p>The State of California’s new program, Engaged California, is being managed and developed by the Office of Data and Innovation (ODI). ODI works collaboratively with state agencies and stakeholders to improve services for Californians. We use data, human-centered design training, and technology to create services that are easier for everyone to use. Our work uses qualitative and quantitative user research and puts Californians at the heart of service design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But what does that look like in practice?</p>

<p>Our cameras captured a day in the life at the ODI HQ during a special event we called Codefest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For 2 days in June, the staff was coding, designing, testing theories, and putting emerging technologies in practice. They did this alongside Carnegie Endowment For International Peace, Berggruen Institute, Ethelo, and Taiwan’s first digital minister, Audrey Tang.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This high-energy sprint was aimed toward one big goal: building a more inclusive, accessible, and human-centered platform.</p>

<p>Over the course of just 2 days, staff and our partners tackled 2 essential challenge areas: language access and content moderation. From SMS-based tools that invite feedback in multiple languages to prototypes for visual storytelling and emotional resonance, teams built tangible ideas designed to bridge real-world divides.</p>

<p>ODI Director Jeffery Marino reflected on what made Codefest so powerful:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We can&#8217;t transform government the way that we want to without all hands on deck. Bringing together the best in California state government with the private sector and nonprofits is something we need to continue to do, and do more of, as we work toward a more efficient, effective, and engaged California.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leadership and peers provided live feedback, helping refine ideas that may soon evolve into full pilot projects. Teams left with clear next steps: refine their concepts, test with real users, and potentially scale their solutions to support language access, feedback loops, and digital equity across the state.</p>

<p>Codefest participants also reflected the broader mission of Engaged California: a platform built to ensure all Californians, not just the loudest voices, can participate in shaping public decisions.</p>

<p>A global leader in <a href="https://youtu.be/568oa6yabKA">digital democracy</a>, Taiwan’s digital minister and civic tech pioneer, Audrey Tang brought her unique insight and experience to Codefest. Her words captured the spirit of what we’re building through Engaged California:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This is not social media. Social media is a broadcasting platform where the loudest voices are often the most extreme. Engaged California is pro-social media, a space for middle ground, common ground, and uncommon ground to be heard. If you value building bridges between communities, this is a platform for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we continue developing this program, ODI remains focused on applying these lessons to future projects. Whether it’s a more inclusive feedback process or an accessible digital tool, the results of Codefest 2025 are already shaping what’s next.</p>

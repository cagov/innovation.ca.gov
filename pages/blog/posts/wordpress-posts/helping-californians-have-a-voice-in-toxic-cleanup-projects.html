<p>The Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) gives Californians the opportunity to comment on proposed toxic substance cleanup projects. They wanted to bring in people who have historically not been part of making decisions. The Office of Data and Innovation (ODI) worked with DTSC to find ways to give these communities a bigger voice in decisions.</p>

<p>We learned that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Current comment opportunities were limited</li>

<li>Information was often hard to understand</li>

<li>Communities of interest were often defined narrowly</li>
</ul>

<p>This project was part of the<a href="https://innovation.ca.gov/data-and-innovation-fund/"> Data and Innovation Fund</a> (DIF). This is one way ODI helps the state improve services for all Californians.<br>Email <a href="mailto:dif@innovation.ca.gov">dif@innovation.ca.gov</a> to learn more about DIF or this project.</p>

<p>A brand new website, designed to serve as a one-stop resource for state staff and the innovator community has launched. <a href="http://genai.ca.gov">GenAI.ca.gov</a> is a new digital resource that continues to deliver upon Governor Gavin Newsom’s Executive Order on Generative AI (<a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/AI-EO-No.12-_-GGN-Signed.pdf">EO N-12-23</a>).</p>

<p>The site answers key questions that state teams may have as they work through the emerging technology road map, walking them through the steps necessary to determine if generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) will meet their business needs to better serve Californians, how to access those tools, and how to take training in procuring and operating GenAI solutions.</p>

<p>It also is designed to serve as a “front door” for GenAI vendor-innovators looking to connect directly with procurement opportunities and for anyone interested in learning more about the State’s work.</p>

<p>“This is a user-centered site with the dual purpose of illustrating how California continues to lead in implementing GenAI to improve government services and our commitment to the user experience of state staff,” said Office of Data and Innovation (ODI) Director Jeffery Marino. “ODI’s expertise in a product approach resulted in ensuring human-centered design through user research to figure out ways to reduce the complexity of the GenAI user journey. ODI also ensured the website meets the state’s plain language standard. The ultimate outcome is to enable the state to quickly adopt safe and trustworthy AI to improve outcomes for Californians.”</p>

<p>The website is a collaboration between ODI and the California Department of Technology (CDT). ODI and CDT are among more than a dozen state entities tasked with delivering on the Governor’s Executive Order on GenAI.</p>

<p>“Now more than ever, strong leadership rooted with research, strategic planning, and tools is what makes California a leader in leveraging GenAI to improve service delivery for residents,” said State Chief Information Officer and CDT Director Liana Bailey-Crimmins. “This website showcases the State’s GenAI journey and use case successes in California government.”</p>

<p>The GenAI website was built using the latest version of the State Web Template that CDT built and continues to enhance. This template factors in accessibility standards, is modular, mobile-friendly, and ensures a consistent and easy user experience.&nbsp;</p>

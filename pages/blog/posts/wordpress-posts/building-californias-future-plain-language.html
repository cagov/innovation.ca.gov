<p>In January 2024, California launched <em>Building California’s future</em> (<a href="http://build.ca.gov">build.ca.gov</a>). It&#8217;s a website that shares how the state is investing billions in infrastructure.</p>

<p>The key to all this transparency? Making it easy to understand with plain language. Plain language is text your audience can understand the first time they read it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A historic opportunity</h2>

<p>Infrastructure funding is a big deal. It improves communities across the state. And it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The federal government is giving the state a historic amount of funds for this work over the next 10 years. When combined with state funds, it totals $180 billion. More than $40 billion of those funds are already at work in California.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Assembling the team</h2>

<p>Governor Gavin Newsom formed an <a href="https://build.ca.gov/about/">Infrastructure Strike Team</a> (Executive Order N-8-23) to help accelerate projects that lead to a brighter future for our state. It has more than 100 members from dozens of state departments.</p>

<p>They identified projects that support:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>clean energy,</li>

<li>better transportation,</li>

<li>a restored environment,</li>

<li>better connectivity, and</li>

<li>more technology made in California. </li>
</ul>

<p>They focused on projects that fight climate change and increase equity.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make it plain</h2>

<p>You should know how these dollars are at work in your community. So the Governor tasked the Infrastructure Strike Team with tracking project details. A website was built by a cross-department team from <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/">CDT</a>, <a href="https://www.govops.ca.gov/">GovOps</a>, and <a href="http://innovation.ca.gov">ODI</a> to help track projects.</p>

<p>The website needed to avoid terms understood only by legislators and construction workers. The average person would likely not understand them. So we wrote the site’s content in plain language.</p>

<p>We used a new <a href="https://hub.innovation.ca.gov/content-design/plain-language-equity-standard/">plain language standard</a> for state government that ODI helped create. The Governor required this standard to increase equity in how we serve Californians.</p>

<p>It requires that text written for the public have:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Grade 8 reading level or lower</li>

<li>Simple sentences with one idea each</li>

<li>Short, common words</li>
</ul>

<p>To meet this goal, we removed acronyms and jargon. We simplified hard-to-read sentences. We co-wrote clear and accurate project stories with Strike Team members.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The result</h2>

<p><a href="http://build.ca.gov">Build.ca.gov</a> is now live, and has a Grade 7 reading level. It offers a list of projects in California that you can search and filter. A map shows the distribution of projects across the state. Spotlight stories show the local impact of better infrastructure.</p>

<p>The site is a significant achievement on many levels. It lets you learn about infrastructure projects near you or far away. It gives the 10-year view of these projects in the state. And it delivers all this in language that you don’t have to struggle to understand.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A plain language future</h2>

<p>Using plain language is an essential part of ODI’s philosophy of meeting people where they are. It&#8217;s one way we model how to better serve Californians.</p>

<p>And plain language is a practice that’s catching on in California state government. More departments are simplifying the language they use with the public. They found that clear, direct words build trust. ODI now offers a <a href="https://hub.innovation.ca.gov/content-design/introduction-plain-language-public-sector/">course on plain language</a> to California state employees. And we’ve added <a href="https://hub.innovation.ca.gov/#plain-language-equity-toolkit">plain language resources</a> to our online Innovation Hub.

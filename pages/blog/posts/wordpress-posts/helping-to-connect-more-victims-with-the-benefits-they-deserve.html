<p>The California Victims Compensation Board (CalVCB) offers financial assistance to victims of crime. While violent crime has gone up over time in California, applications for compensation have gone down. The Office of Data and Innovation (ODI) worked with CalVCB to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Understand why fewer eligible people were applying to their fund</li>

<li>Find out how to reach them</li>

<li>Increase applications</li>
</ul>

<p>We learned that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Centering the victim experience is crucial to improvements</li>

<li>Enabling victim supporters leads to better outcomes</li>

<li>Improving victim engagement can increase uptake</li>
</ul>

This is one way ODI helps the state improve services for all Californians.<br>Email <a href="mailto:dif@innovation.ca.gov">dif@innovation.ca.gov</a> to learn more about DIF or this project.</p>

<p>Engaged California has officially launched, and more than 6,000 people have already signed up to participate.</p>

<p>Governor Newsom recently called out the strong start to the program in his <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/03/20/sign-ups-soar-as-thousands-join-the-conversation-on-californias-new-deliberative-democracy-platform/">recent press release</a> and video.</p>

<p>Those who opted in for the first use case–focused on the LA wildfire recovery efforts–have accepted their invitation to join the first phase of the discussion. This marks a major milestone in the state’s effort to amplify the voices of Californians and help shape the policies that affect them most.</p>

<p>Engaged California has been years in the making. ODI is proud to be leading this effort, in collaboration with the Government Operations Agency (GovOps) and our partners, including the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Our goal is that this program will drive technology for good to bring people closer to the decisions shaping their lives.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>LA fires recovery</strong></h2>

<p>More than 6,000 people have subscribed to the program, with more than half who opted in to participate in this first use case. The list is growing each week.</p>

<p>ODI created a new page that now serves as a comprehensive hub for the wildfire recovery engagement. This new resource offers essential information about the deliberation process, explains how people can participate, and highlights the values behind California’s approach to deliberative democracy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s new on the website</strong></h2>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>A visual timeline</strong>: A clear, phase-by-phase look at the journey–from agenda setting to deliberation and reporting</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>What to expect</strong>: Guidance for participants about where the process currently stands and what’s coming next</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Deliberative democracy explainer</strong>: A helpful overview of how this approach differs from traditional public input methods like polling or town halls</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Language accessibility</strong>: All information is available in eight different languages, increasing access and awareness of the process</li>
</ul>

<p>ODI Director Jeffery Marino reflected on the impact of the Engaged California launch:</p>

<div class="wp-block-group cagov-pull-quote">
<p class="cagov-pull-quote-content">It is so rewarding to see people in the platform, starting to shape the conversation. We know that those who have been impacted by the devastating fires in Altadena and Pacific Palisades have important things to say about their life experiences. Engaged California is here to meet that need, and ODI is proud to be heading up this effort.</p>


<p>“Carnegie California is grateful to be on the ground floor, providing our expertise to inform the development of California’s deliberative democracy program”, said Ian Klaus, Founding director of Carnegie California. “It is wonderful that California is committed to grounding this work in best practices from knowledge partners in the state and around the globe to improve public engagement and strengthen democracy with digital tools.”</p>

<p>Again, this is a huge milestone for Engaged California, and we are just getting started. We’re gearing up to move to the next phases of the program and to see Californians actively participating in a space built to support meaningful, inclusive public dialogue.</p>

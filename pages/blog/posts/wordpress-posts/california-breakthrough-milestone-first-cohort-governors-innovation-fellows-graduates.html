<p>Last summer, 21 state workers walked into a training room at the Office of Data and Innovation (ODI). Each is a subject matter expert in their field, representing 9 agencies and 15 departments. Their goal? To find ways to make California government more efficient, effective, and engaged as the first cohort of the Governor’s Innovation Fellows. Governor Newsom launched the Innovation Fellows Program through the California Breakthrough Project <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-7-15.Efficient-and-Effective-Government-EO.FINAL_.signed-1.pdf">executive order</a>.</p>

<p>California is home to the most innovative talent, including within our state workforce. The Fellows program is an all-hands approach to efficiency led by Governor Newsom and prioritizes upskilling from within. The goal is to break down silos and create a network of efficiency experts within government, while partnering with experts from the private sector and academia. This type of collaboration is intended to improve how the state serves all Californians.</p>

<p>“This isn’t a traditional leadership program. It was built as a delivery engine, to develop leaders while producing improvements that make a difference for Californians today and for the future,” <strong>said ODI Director Jeffery Marino</strong>. “Today, we celebrate all the efforts of the first cohort as they graduate and look forward to where this innovative program will take us in the state.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the Fellows program works</h2>

<p>So where did the Fellows come from? They were nominated by their agency secretaries and department directors. They spent six months co-creating a program, tools, and processes that can scale across state government. The Fellows spend 80% of their time immersed in projects that have benefits both inside and outside government. So far, they have dedicated 17,000 hours of work on 25 transformative projects, including:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Researching ways to streamline college students’ eligibility for CalFresh (food benefits)</li>

<li>Scoping a centralized platform to help users quickly find the right state grants and reduce time wasted on applications they don&#8217;t qualify for (<a href="https://bit.ly/3Oj8zrD">Read the grants portal case study</a>)</li>

<li>Using digital tools to make planning and environmental review processes (CEQA and Permitting) faster, cheaper, and clearer for everyone</li>

<li>Reimagining digital services that don’t rely on a Californian to navigate state department silos</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, Fellows have been focused on improving internal processes, updating public-facing documents to meet plain language standards, and creating customer feedback loops.</p>

<p>They received hands-on training from ODI’s CalAcademy team during a week-long bootcamp, where they focused on human centered design — a product approach — as opposed to just project management. They also learned the value of research, and data analysis. They met with leaders inside and outside of government, including partners in the private sector and academia.</p>

<p class="cagov-pull-quote-content">These are major, large-lift, cross-cutting efficiency projects that improve service delivery statewide. Thinking they could be solved in six months wasn’t the real goal. But the lesson here is you have to start somewhere. And ODI is providing them the training they need to drive success.</p>

<p>The California Breakthrough Project, established within ODI and developed with the Governor’s Office, provides an embedded mechanism for continuous improvement in state programs and services. Breakthrough advises and supports the Fellows as they design solutions that improve effectiveness and engagement,</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s next?</h2>

<p>The Governor’s Innovation Fellows Program will continue to grow. The second cohort of 21 Fellows is currently underway, with a third cohort planned for this summer. Each group will build upon the last to share their knowledge and build momentum, passing the baton so that progress continues without interruption. Their continued work will strengthen how government delivers services and meets the needs of all Californians.</p>

<p>Providing exceptional customer service for Californians begins with understanding the needs of the people we serve. At the Office of Data and Innovation (ODI), we work with other state departments to help provide better services through training, research, data analysis, and human-centered design. Our latest CalAcademy course for the state workforce is <em>Introduction to a product approach for the public sector</em>. It gives state employees the training in innovative skills they need to adopt an iterative approach to service delivery.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a product approach?</h2>

<p>In the public sector, products aren’t just websites or apps. They’re also policies, programs, processes, and services that solve problems and deliver long-term impact.</p>

<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="438" height="375" src="https://live-digital-ca-gov.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/measure-build-test.png" alt="The product approach cycle: build, test, measure and learn. Customers' needs stay at the forefront." class="wp-image-2700 size-full"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>A product approach means:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Measuring success and making improvements based on real feedback</li>

<li>Putting people’s needs at the center of everything we build</li>

<li>Understanding the problem before jumping to solutions</li>

<li>Delivering value early and continuously</li>
</ul>
</div></div>

<p>This new course breaks down four key principles to help teams apply this mindset in their own work, whether that’s streamlining a form, launching a new service, improving an existing program, or updating a policy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why it matters</h2>

<p>People expect government services to work the first time, be easy to use, and reflect their real-life needs. By following a product approach, state teams can deliver faster, more accessible, and more effective services. This method also helps reduce risk and builds trust with the public through early wins and continuous improvements.</p>

<p>The course walks through:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>How to measure outcomes–not just outputs–and make improvements over time</li>

<li>How to prioritize people’s needs by building empathy and listening to people affected</li>

<li>Ways to define the right problem–before building the solution</li>

<li>How to deliver early prototypes, minimum viable products (MVPs), and feedback loops</li>
</ul>

This training builds on that foundation—giving teams a new way to design with empathy, deliver with purpose, and stay focused on the real needs of the people we serve.

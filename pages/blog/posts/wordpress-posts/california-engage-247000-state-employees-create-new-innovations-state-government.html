<p>As part of Governor Gavin Newsom’s Executive Order to advance government effectiveness and efficiency (<a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/07/15/governor-newsom-advances-government-effectiveness-and-efficiency-with-new-executive-order-launches-task-force-with-tech-industry-leaders/">N-30-25</a>), the Office of Data and Innovation (ODI) has launched the state’s second Engaged California project to source innovative ideas designed to&nbsp;identify any barriers preventing an efficient and effective government as well as to discover opportunities to better serve Californians.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group cagov-pull-quote"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p class="cagov-pull-quote-content">Participants will bring a unique perspective. Not only is California home, but they also understand how our government serves its residents. That is a very powerful perspective and provides a unique opportunity to transform government from the inside out. Their perspective will be instrumental in creating the efficient and effective government that Californians deserve.</p>

<p><strong><br></strong>The value in this new engagement is that it recognizes the value of state employees as Californians first, coupled with their public service and subject matter expertise.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group cagov-pull-quote"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p class="cagov-pull-quote-content">State employees are a wealth of knowledge and they routinely bring ideas to the forefront. This process will help us formalize those ideas and create a pipeline that may make their work more engaging, efficient and bring customer centric solutions to those we serve.</p>

<p>This endeavor shows the versatility and flexibility of the new Engaged California platform. The first conversation, which is still ongoing, invited LA wildfire survivors to first share their needs to recover, and is now currently recruiting participants to rate their priority areas for rebuilding. It shows how innovation, paired with technology, can listen at scale in a more effective way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The upcoming state employee engagement will leverage this successful model to bring more voices into a new conversation. The state employs more than 247,000 people in jobs that keep our roads safe, provide safe drinking water, answer customer service calls and assuring Californians get the benefits they deserve.</p>

<p>Beginning on August 4, state employees interested in participating can begin to sign up and be part of the process.&nbsp;On August 15, invitations to the platform will be sent and they will then be able to participate in the conversation about how they can contribute their ideas and see what others have to say.</p>

<p>State employees who want to participate are asked to sign up at <a href="https://engaged.ca.gov/stateemployees/">engaged.ca.gov/stateemployees</a>.</p>

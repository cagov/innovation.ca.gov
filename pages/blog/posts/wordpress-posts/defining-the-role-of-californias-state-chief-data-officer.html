<p>In the rapidly evolving world of data, the Chief Data Officer (CDO) role has become increasingly vital to government operations. But what does a CDO really <strong>do</strong>? The answer can look different depending on the organization. Still, the core responsibilities often revolve around three key areas: advocating for people, developing a strategy to drive better outcomes, and defining what “data” truly means to guide the State toward the highest value use of data.</p>

<p>As the State of California Chief Data Officer, I’ve come to understand how important it is to navigate these diverse responsibilities with care. Let me walk you through what that looks like.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chief advocate for the people in the data and the people of the data</h2>

<p>I see the role of State Chief Data Officer as a chief advocate for the people in the data and the people of the data. Let me explain.</p>

<p><strong>Advocate for the people in the data.</strong> First, I believe the State CDO advocates for the residents of California whose data is collected, managed, and used by state agencies. This is about ensuring that data is used ethically, with respect for privacy and security. It also means finding ways to use data to deliver better outcomes for Californians. Our residents deserve to know that their information is handled responsibly and in a way that helps them live fuller lives. As CDO, it’s my role to ensure those protections are in place while also driving the use of data for better outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>Advocate for the people of the data.</strong> Second, and just as critical, this means supporting the incredible data professionals across the state—analysts, scientists, engineers—ensuring they have what they need to succeed. Data initiatives don’t move forward without the people behind them. I’m focused on ensuring State data professionals have the tools, resources, and guidance to thrive in a rapidly changing field. This means advocating for modern platforms, upskilling, and creating an environment where diverse data talent can flourish.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Developing a State Data Strategy</h2>

<p>Advocacy feeds directly into strategy. My north star is <a href="https://innovation.ca.gov/blog/posts/advancing-equity-bringing-heart-to-data/">advancing equity</a>, which will animate the continuous development of California’s State Data Strategy. To be an effective advocate for both the data workforce and our residents, you need a solid strategy that aligns with those goals.</p>

<p>In California, our data strategy focuses on a few foundational goals:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Streamline data access</strong>. Improved data infrastructure ensures we have the right systems to manage, process, and use information efficiently and effectively.</li>

<li><strong>Improve data management. </strong>Data governance is about creating a framework for securely sharing and using data across state agencies and departments. We need to balance portability with privacy to serve our residents best.</li>

<li><strong>Spur data use and ability.</strong> Data literacy and skills development are essential. Collecting data is not enough—we need people at all levels of government to understand and work with it to inform decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The ultimate goal is to serve Californians better with data</strong>, where the data we collect, manage, and use leads directly to better policy, service delivery, customer experience, and program outcomes for Californians.</p>

<p>Building California’s data strategy is an ongoing and collaborative effort. As I shape the roadmap as State CDO with the team, we will go on a listening tour and conduct surveys&nbsp; to align as best we can with addressing the shared and priority challenges the California government faces.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Data as a business asset</h2>

<p>Data is a critical business asset, especially as more and more emerging technologies like GenAI rely on quality data for quality outputs. Just like we inventory our physical assets so we can manage them, data too must be defined and managed. And though it doesn’t need to be tracked in physical space, we must understand it so that it can be put to work for the benefit of Californians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starting with the outcomes in mind and the missions of our state organizations, we can work backwards to identify the data necessary to accomplish our organizational goals. The needs of our residents change over time, so we also need to be adaptive and responsive with our use of data while appropriately managing privacy and security. This is a collective and collaborative effort among our executive and program leaders who set organizational and program vision, data leaders and professionals who can match data and insights to the need, and technology staff and leaders who can ensure data is stored and managed with the appropriate security.</p>

<p>That’s why managing data is not just a technical exercise—it’s a critical step in driving value for organizations across the state and requires multiple perspectives at the table to get it right.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The role of the State CDO is multifaceted—advocate, strategist, and guide. It’s a position that requires a careful balance of supporting internal teams while advancing how we serve residents. In California, we’re building a future where data works for the people, informing policy, protecting rights, and creating better resident outcomes. That journey is ongoing, and I’m committed to ensuring we keep moving forward with purpose and integrity.</p>

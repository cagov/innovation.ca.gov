<p>When we first got the call from Governor Newsom to help shape what would become <strong>Engaged California</strong>, we were both honored and excited. As longtime advocates for inclusive governance, it was clear this program was a chance to help Californians connect with each other and their government in more meaningful, modern ways—truly embodying the vision Governor Newsom laid out in <em>Citizenville</em>. For each of us, this work is personal: we’ve seen firsthand how everyday people’s voices can shape policy when given the right tools and genuine opportunities to participate. We want to help make that a reality for millions of Californians.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A collaboration rooted in expertise and shared values</h2>

<p>Engaged California represents a deep collaboration between the California Office of Data and Innovation (ODI) and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. We’ve brought together technologists, policymakers, civic design experts, and researchers to harness emerging best practices in democracy innovation. Our joint mission is to make public engagement more inclusive and informed so that every voice can be heard in policy decisions, no matter how remote or marginalized.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Engaged California matters</h2>

<p>Traditional public engagement methods, such as elections, interest groups, and public meetings, are critical in shaping policy and governance. Elections provide a vital foundation for democratic decision-making. Interest groups bring essential perspectives. Public meetings create opportunities for dialogue and input. However, these methods alone may not always capture the full diversity of public perspectives or make space for in-depth, informed conversations. Many Californians have busy schedules, face travel barriers, or feel disconnected from the policy process. Engaged California offers a new way for folks across the state to weigh in whenever it’s convenient for them, on issues that matter most.</p>

<p>By bringing modern approaches and tools to deliberation, we also aim to foster dialogue among residents with differing perspectives. Rather than relying solely on majority opinions, Engaged California will highlight areas of consensus, disagreement, and creative ideas—all in a safe, moderated environment.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A vision for the future</h2>

<p>The Engaged California program is designed to evolve over time intentionally. We recognized the opportunity to use a deliberative approach to amplify the voices of survivors in Los Angeles. After listening to affected residents, it became clear that there is concern and confusion regarding what recovery entails and how the government will be involved in that process. The first engagement aims to listen and take action during the recovery process. However, our vision is to create a vibrant public space where Californians can actively participate in shaping the decisions that impact their lives on a variety of topics. We plan to achieve this vision through several approaches:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ongoing user-centered research. </strong>We conduct focus groups and interviews to understand how Californians want to engage. We then adapt our tools and approach to make it simple and welcoming for everyone.<br></li>

<li><strong>Using data to inform policy actions and improvements in the program. </strong>We analyze platform discussions (while protecting individual privacy) to identify emerging themes, reveal key areas of consensus, and continuously improve how we facilitate engagements.<br></li>

<li><strong>Scaling for diversity and accessibility. </strong>We collaborate with local governments, libraries, and community-based organizations to ensure people have reliable internet access and the support they need to participate. We’re also experimenting with emerging technologies to support multi-lingual deliberations.<br></li>

<li><strong>Developing a deliberative democracy innovation lab. </strong>We are developing an innovation lab approach to research and test new technologies, drawing inspiration from international best practices, such as those in Taiwan, and guided by advanced research. Our focus ranges from online facilitation tools to more immersive meeting formats. The ultimate goal remains the same: to strengthen human connections and expand participation, aligning with the vision outlined in Citizenville.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How you can get involved</h2>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://engaged.ca.gov"><strong>Sign up</strong></a> – Participate in the first deliberation or just sign up to be notified when new topics are announced. When it’s your turn, join the platform and share your voice.</li>

<li><strong>Spread the word</strong> – Invite neighbors, friends, and family—especially those who might not be connected to traditional forms of democratic participation.</li>

<li><strong>Give feedback</strong> – We need your input on everything from the online experience to the topics you care about most. Every piece of feedback helps us improve. We are designing multiple opportunities for people to set the agenda, deliberate among each other, and provide new and better ideas for government action in critical areas.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Shaping California, one conversation at a time</h2>

<p>Ultimately, this program is about realizing Governor Newsom’s vision of a more connected, innovative democracy that harnesses technology to bring people closer to the decisions shaping their lives. We believe Engaged California can become the gold standard for participatory governance, empowering each of us to help solve the tough challenges facing our state.</p>

<p>We’re grateful for the chance to collaborate and deeply committed to building a platform that amplifies Californians’ voices. Together, let’s shape a future where policy decisions are informed not just by a few—but by the diverse insights, experiences, and wisdom of all who call this state home.</p>

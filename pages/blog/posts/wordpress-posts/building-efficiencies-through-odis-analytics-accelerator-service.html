<p>Data can help us find insights and make faster decisions. It can also take a lot of time to process and analyze.</p>

<p>At the Office of Data and Innovation (ODI), our mission is to drive innovation across California state government. We use data, technology, and human-centered design to achieve equitable outcomes for all Californians and improve service delivery.</p>

<p>ODI is proud to announce our latest data service: the Analytics Accelerator. It is a 12-week, no-cost service designed to help departments make better use of their data. Participants learn how to automate data processes and reporting. They also learn user-centered data practices to design effective data visualizations. <strong>The result leads to greater department efficiency and tools that are easy to use and deliver value.</strong></p>

<p>The Analytics Accelerator is free to all State of California employees. All the tools we use are also free, and most state employees already have access to them.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Greater department efficiency</h2>

<p>Most state departments and employees have access to a tool known as Power BI. It’s a Microsoft business intelligence tool (hence “BI”) that allows users to analyze and visualize data to improve their work. Through the Analytics Accelerator, ODI is training participants how to use Power BI to significantly reduce manual effort. We also teach participants best practices in user design. This ensures that the dashboards are easy to use and genuinely helpful. This helps departments understand their data better, make more informed decisions, and work more effectively.</p>

<p>“The Analytics Accelerator is a shining example of how human-centered design can make a difference,” said Matthew Zhou, Assistant State Chief Data Officer. “By equipping public servants in California state government with the right tools and training to automate, analyze, and visualize data effectively, this program empowers state staff to effectively leverage their data to deliver more efficient and accessible public services for Californians.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the program works</h2>

<p><strong>The service is designed to help a team learn and grow</strong>. People from different divisions within a department form part of a cohort. They move through the same learning path, share ideas, and learn from each other.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In parallel with the coursework, <strong>participants also work on a project </strong>using Power BI.<strong> </strong>Every project helps solve a real problem within their department. This means applying new skills right away and directly improving operational efficiency. After 12 weeks, participants will have built a first iteration of a data product.</p>

<p><strong>Participants receive mentoring throughout the service</strong>. Every team and every project is unique. One-on-one coaching allows for faster problem-solving, tailored solutions, and reinforcement of concepts.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The first cohort</h2>

<p>In March 2024, we launched the Analytics Accelerator and worked with 20 teams across 7 departments. We focused on 3 main themes:&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Building team skills</li>

<li>Increasing efficiency in data management and reporting</li>

<li>Improving the ability for data-driven decision making</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What participants are saying</h2>

<div class="wp-block-group cagov-pull-quote"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p class="cagov-pull-quote-content">The Analytics Accelerator training has been a huge help in reducing my workload, both in my day-to-day work and into the future. While I’d been using Power BI for a few years before the training, I’d never found training that taught me what the Analytics Accelerator did, particularly in the Query Editor and in formula writing.</p>

<p>Done/doing is a recap of what we’ve done this week and what we have in our sprint plan for the week ahead. This post covers the week of December 16–22.</p>

<h2>Done</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Developed MVP <a href="https://github.com/cagov/cwds/issues/17">design system</a> and page templates</li>
	<li>Collected 50+ responses on the <general Alpha survey</li>
	<li>Guest team members (shout to CHHS Office of Innovation!) tested the <a href="https://github.com/cagov/UX/issues">State Holiday prototype</a> to learn how to handle 4th of July and validated that we want to keep Next Holiday feature</li>
	<li>Conducted a <a href="https://twitter.com/CAdotGov/status/1207440359782928384">field research visit</a> to Vital Records office in South Sacramento to test “Request a birth certificate” with guest team members from CHHS Innovation team</li>
	<li>Built new Function As A Service (<a href="https://github.com/cagov/FunctionApps">FAAS</a>, also called “serverless”) prototype and Github integrated deployment pipeline</li>
	<li>Setup <a href="https://github.com/cagov/cwds/issues/3">initial docs</a> for our bootstrap based design system, rewrote first bootstrap interactive UI widget as a web component, allowing us to provide the same functionality with much smaller code footprint</li>
	<li>Prototyped additional <a href="https://github.com/cagov/UX/issues">user stories</a>, augmented our minimum wage user prototype so it autocompletes all cities and zip codes in CA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Doing</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Iterate on new content type templates so we can prototype user stories faster and cleaner</li>
	<li>Integrate accessibility testing tools into our code editors as automated linters, and into the CI pipeline as automated tests and into our browsers for manual testing</li>
	<li>Design discussion guide for deep, qualitative research on victims of trauma and wildfire</li>
	<li>Begin development on the site functionality required for Alpha site to support user story content</li>
</ul>

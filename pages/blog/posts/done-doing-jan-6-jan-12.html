<p>Our work this week has been focused on releasing our first round of prototypes. As we speak, we’re elbows deep in the final push to finish Spanish translations, domain name clean up, purging the CDN, troubleshooting cache issues, QAing, and a million other critical details.</p>

<p>Check out our <a href="https://github.com/cagov/Alpha/issues/93">GitHub Issue Alpha #93</a> to see how we’re organizing our work and sprinting to the release.</p>

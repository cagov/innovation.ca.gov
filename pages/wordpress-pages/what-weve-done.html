<p class="emphasized">The Office of Digital Innovation (ODI) works on projects where we can measurably improve state services.</p>

<h2>Featured projects</h2>

<h3>Vaccine sentiment analytics</h3>

<p>We developed a vaccine sentiment scoring model. It used digital surveys on the state’s highest traffic websites and the <a href="https://healthyplacesindex.org/">Healthy Places Index</a>. Our model identified underserved communities that were likely to get vaccinated. These insights informed where the state deployed vaccine resources.</p>

<h3>COVID19.CA.GOV</h3>

<p>Thanks to best practice design, California’s pandemic response website performs well on all devices. We gathered user feedback to adjust our design to help people find what they were looking for. Sometimes we even adjusted the words to match what our visitors used. While continuing to serve millions of people weekly, covid19.ca.gov has become a demonstration project for engineering, research, UX and content design best practices.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>California Design System</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/">California Design System</a> brings best practice engineering to state websites. Its components are built based on research into common needs of state digital teams. It also includes design guidelines with ready-to-use tips.</p>

<h3>Page feedback</h3>

<p>This survey tool allows teams to discover what people think of a service or program. Created for covid19.ca.gov, it’s now <a href="https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/components/page-feedback/readme/">part of the California Design System</a>. We’re helping other departments add page feedback so they can learn directly from their users. .&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Accessibility and performance</h3>

<p>ODI’s commitment to accessibility goes beyond WCAG standards. We commit to grade 6 reading levels to help everyone better understand content. Instead of designing for new smartphones, we make sure our products work well on all devices. We have created automated performance testing tools, using data to inform our work.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How we choose projects</h2>

<p>Our evaluation criteria considers things like:</p>

<ul><li>Is this service critical to the lives of Californians?</li><li>Does it impact large or underserved populations?</li><li>How many state entities are involved in the service?</li><li>Can our work on this service be applied to other services?</li><li>What previous efforts can we build on?</li></ul>

<p>If you’re interested in working with ODI, we’d love to hear from you.</p>

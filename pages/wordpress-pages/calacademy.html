<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Our mission and values</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We support ODIâ€™s mission of driving innovation across the state. We work with state staff to build their innovation, technical, and design skills. When we partner with departments to train staff, this helps sustain service improvements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our work increases equity. We help state staff learn how to consult and codesign with Californians. This increases the chance a service will help the people who use it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We embrace continuous improvement. We embed process and content evaluation into our work. This helps us make iterative changes to better meet the needs of state staff.</p>

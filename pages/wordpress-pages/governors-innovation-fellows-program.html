<p class="cagov-emphasized">The Governorâ€™s Innovation Fellows are state employees solving real public sector challenges. The program brings them together to improve services for Californians.</p>

<p>The first cohort includes 21 employees. For 6 months, the Fellows will work on priority projects. They will make government more efficient, effective, and responsive to the public.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Applying product approaches</li>

<li>Using data</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why it matters</h2>

<p>Governor Newsom launched this program as part of a broader executive order. Its goal is to make state government efficient, engaged, and effective. We chose the Fellows for their initiative, creativity, and problem-solving skills.</p>

<p>The Innovation Fellows Program isn&#8217;t like a traditional leadership program. We designed it to be a delivery engine. It develops leaders while creating real improvements that help Californians.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Looking ahead</h2>

<p>The program will grow over time. New Fellows will join every 4 months. They will overlap with the earlier cohort so they can share knowledge and work together.</p>

<p><strong>What You Need to Know:</strong> Relying on the state workforce’s expertise in delivering services for Californians, the Office of Data and Innovation invited employees to participate in the Engaged California program, to share their recommendations on how to improve government efficiency.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Jan. 28, 2026, Sacramento, CA: </strong>Californians show up to work each day with a singular mission: to serve their fellow residents. They are the subject matter experts who understand exactly what it takes to operate state government and are best positioned to identify its most pressing challenges.</p>

<p>Engaged California invited these frontline experts to the table. Over a 10-week period, 1,469 state employees shared their insights on how to build a more effective government. The result? Ideas that go far beyond simple cost-cutting measures.</p>

<p>“These weren&#8217;t abstract comments. Employees came prepared with concrete solutions: from process improvement and workforce retention to technology modernization and management culture. These are experts in their fields of work, and this conversation empowers them to participate and share their ideas in building a more efficient and effective state government,” said ODI Director Jeffery Marino.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Employees shared over 2,400 anonymous comments and provided more than 2,600 ideas on how they would make state government more efficient. Participants worked for agencies and departments from across the state. Most were frontline staff working below the managerial level.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we heard</h2>

<p>The message from state employees is clear: improving government efficiency isn&#8217;t just about updating technology or trimming budgets. It requires a fundamental shift in management culture, one that empowers employees and creates space for innovation.</p>

<p>The employees’ suggestions were grouped into 10 categories. The top three categories were:&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Communication and knowledge sharing&nbsp;</li>

<li>Recruitment, hiring and retention</li>

<li>Process improvement</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some of their comments:</p>

<div class="quote-container style-body-text">
  <div class="quote">“A primary problem is the number of antiquated and inefficient statewide processes still in place across departments.”</div>
  <div class="quote">“In operating such a large government, it is easy to have too many fingers in the mix. It is our responsibility to analyze and identify areas we can cut down on bureaucratic surplus.”</div>
  <div class="quote">“It&#8217;s nice to be able to share my opinions and to broaden my perspectives on what it means to be a public servant.”</div>
</div>

<p>State workers also shared comments about their pride in their work, and their appreciation to serve.</p>

<div class="quote-container style-body-text">
    <div class="quote">“I’m proud to be part of something bigger than myself, serving the public through meaningful and often behind-the-scenes work that helps keep essential operations running smoothly.”</div>
    <div class="quote">“I love the relationships that I have built with the hard-working and dedicated state employees that keep the programs in this state available for everyone. I am continuously amazed at our ability to grow and meet the challenges that come at us every day.”</div>
    <div class="quote">“We are public servants and in my opinion should work together to fulfill the needs of the public, which means we need to create a culture that enables each employee to be encouraged to bring their talents, skills and experience to the table.”</div>
</div>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Efficiency in action</h2>

<p>Employees spoke about the need for teams and agencies to share more and work across silos. Many asked for clear records and shared tools, using simple language. They also want better ways to gather staff input and support the many languages spoken in California. That feedback was synthesized into a top theme of “communication.”</p>

<p>One participant expressed the need in this quote from the platform:</p>

<div class="quote-container style-body-text">
    <div class="quote">“We need digital (mobile-optimized) data intake. The state has SO MANY forms (applications, recertifications, licences, grants, etc.)&#8230; programs across agencies should share their respective data on the backend so a Californian doesn’t have to enter the same data every time they interact with a new program.”</div>

<p>Enter the Governor’s Innovation Fellows.</p>

<p>In response to the Governor’s Executive Order from July, “<a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/07/15/governor-newsom-advances-government-effectiveness-and-efficiency-with-new-executive-order-launches-task-force-with-tech-industry-leaders/">California Breakthrough Project</a>,” the California Office of Data and Innovation launched the <a href="https://innovation.ca.gov/our-work/governors-innovation-fellows-program/">Governor’s Innovation Fellows</a> in July 2025. Members were nominated by Agency Secretaries and Department Directors. The first cohort of 21 state employees kick-started key initiatives driving state modernization and improved services for Californians, with a goal of creating a more effective, efficient, and engaged government.</p>

<p>One of the efforts of the first cohort was put to work on a pilot for the California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA)&#8217;s proposed grants portal, one that could scale to other administrator state teams that provide grants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Fellows explored ways to consolidate data collection for shared applicant data to streamline the customer experience, while maintaining program-specific data collection, as well as ways to improve grant-program matching.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Based on this discovery work with CNRA, there is a path forward for the second cohort of Fellows who began their tenures in January.</p>

<p>In addition to the Fellows, here are the other ways the efficiency efforts are being tracked statewide:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Results.ca.gov</strong>: There are ongoing efforts across the state to meet the need for efficiencies in government. These wins are showcased on the website, <a href="http://results.ca.gov">results.ca.gov.</a> Visitors to the site will see measurable accomplishments that are delivering real impacts.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list">

<li><strong>Innovation Community of Practice</strong>: The report has shown the need for state employees to have a place to share ideas.

It spotlights and amplifies the innovation happening throughout the state. The Community is open to all state employees. <a href="https://innovation.ca.gov/our-work/innovation-community-of-practice/">Learn more and sign up</a> today.</li>

The state employees engagement launched in July as part of the Governor’s <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/07/15/governor-newsom-advances-government-effectiveness-and-efficiency-with-new-executive-order-launches-task-force-with-tech-industry-leaders/">executive order </a>to advance government effectiveness and efficiency.

<p><strong>What You Need to Know:</strong> Relying on the state workforce’s expertise in delivering services for Californians, the Office of Data and Innovation invited employees to participate in the Engaged California program, to share their recommendations on how to improve government efficiency.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Jan. 28, 2026, Sacramento, CA: </strong>Californians show up to work each day with a singular mission: to serve their fellow residents. They are the subject matter experts who understand exactly what it takes to operate state government and are best positioned to identify its most pressing challenges.</p>

<p>Engaged California invited these frontline experts to the table. Over a 10-week period, 1,469 state employees shared their insights on how to build a more effective government. The result? Ideas that go far beyond simple cost-cutting measures.</p>

<p>“These weren&#8217;t abstract comments. Employees came prepared with concrete solutions: from process improvement and workforce retention to technology modernization and management culture. These are experts in their fields of work, and this conversation empowers them to participate and share their ideas in building a more efficient and effective state government,” said ODI Director Jeffery Marino.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Employees shared over 2,400 anonymous comments and provided more than 2,600 ideas on how they would make state government more efficient. Participants worked for agencies and departments from across the state. Most were frontline staff working below the managerial level.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we heard</h2>

<p>The message from state employees is clear: improving government efficiency isn&#8217;t just about updating technology or trimming budgets. It requires a fundamental shift in management culture, one that empowers employees and creates space for innovation.</p>

<p>The employees’ suggestions were grouped into 10 categories. The top three categories were:&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Recruitment, hiring and retention</li>

<li>Process improvement</li>

<li>Communication and knowledge sharing&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some of their comments:</p>

  <div class="quote">“A primary problem is the number of antiquated and inefficient statewide processes still in place across departments.”</div>
  <div class="quote">“In operating such a large government, it is easy to have too many fingers in the mix. It is our responsibility to analyze and identify areas we can cut down on bureaucratic surplus.”</div>
  <div class="quote">“It&#8217;s nice to be able to share my opinions and to broaden my perspectives on what it means to be a public servant,&#8221; one participant reflected, capturing the spirit of appreciation many employees expressed for finally having a seat at the table.”</div>
</div>

<p>State workers also shared comments about their pride in their work, and their appreciation to serve.</p>

<div class="quote-container style-body-text">
    <div class="quote">“We are public servants and in my opinion should work together to fulfill the needs of the public, which means we need to create a culture that enables each employee to be encouraged, to bring their talents, skills and experience to the table.”</div>
</div></div>

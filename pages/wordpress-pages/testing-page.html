<p>Providing exceptional customer service for Californians begins with understanding the needs of the people we serve. At the Office of Data and Innovation (ODI), we work with other state departments to help provide better services through training, research, data analysis, and human-centered design. Our latest CalAcademy course for the state workforce is <em>Introduction to a product approach for the public sector</em>. It gives state employees the training in innovative skills they need to adopt an iterative approach to service delivery.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a product approach?</h2>

<p>In the public sector, products aren’t just websites or apps. They’re also policies, programs, processes, and services that solve problems and deliver long-term impact.</p>

Customers' needs stay at the forefront." class="wp-image-2655"/></figure></div>
<p>A product approach means:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Putting people’s needs at the center of everything we build</li>

<li>Understanding the problem before jumping to solutions</li>

<li>Delivering value early and continuously</li>

<li>Measuring success and making improvements based on real feedback</li>
</ul>

<p>This new course breaks down four key principles to help teams apply this mindset in their own work, whether that’s streamlining a form, launching a new service, improving an existing program, or updating a policy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why it matters</h2>

<p>People expect government services to work the first time, be easy to use, and reflect their real-life needs. By following a product approach, state teams can deliver faster, more accessible, and more effective services. This method also helps reduce risk and builds trust with the public through early wins and continuous improvements.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Foundations of a product approach</h2>

<p>The course walks through:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>How to prioritize people’s needs by building empathy and listening to people affected</li>

<li>Ways to define the right problem–before building the solution</li>

<li>How to deliver early prototypes, minimum viable products (MVPs), and feedback loops</li>

<li>How to measure outcomes–not just outputs–and make improvements over time</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether you’re working on digital services, public-facing processes, or internal tools, this course gives you a practical starting point to create real impact.</p>

<p>“A product approach can make your services even more impactful for Californians,” said Chief Innovation Training Officer Anne Crew-Renzo. “When you start with people’s needs – instead of solely project requirements – you increase the chance you’ll solve the right problem at the right time. A product approach is a great addition to the public servant’s toolkit!”</p>

<p>Service Innovation Deputy Director Koji Kumpulainien emphasized how the training helps teams design with empathy and adapt to evolving public needs: &#8220;Across California’s government, public servants are deeply committed to making a difference. This training builds on that foundation—giving teams a new way to design with empathy, deliver with purpose, and stay focused on the real needs of the people we serve. By using a product approach, we can move from one-time projects to services that grow and adapt as people’s needs change.”</p>

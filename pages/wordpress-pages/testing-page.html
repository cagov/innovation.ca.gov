<p>It’s an honor to be the State of California’s new Assistant Chief Data Officer! I’m immensely grateful to be trusted with this responsibility by Governor Newsom, the&nbsp; Director of the Office of Data and Innovation (ODI), Jeffery Marino, and California’s State Chief Data Officer, Jason Lally. ODI’s vision of a California state government that is equitable, innovative, and constantly improving is a mission that I’m incredibly excited to support.</p>

<p>California has always been a storied place for me. It’s a land that nurtures innovators who invent new technologies that transform the world, a place for dreamers and storytellers, and a determined leader in the long fight for equity and justice within American history. As a kid, I remember my father once telling me wistfully about his dream to one day move our family to the city of San Diego, find a job in its electrical engineering industry there, and build a life in California. Now as an adult, making a home in this state and getting to serve Californians in this role feels like a lifelong wish come true.</p>

<p>As an immigrant (and the son of immigrants), taking this role is a responsibility that feels deeply personal for me. Throughout my life, I’ve gained access to so many opportunities with the help of a government program or service.</p>

<p>I first moved to the U.S. from Australia, where I was born, when I was 7 years old. I grew up going to public school in the Chicago suburbs, encouraged by teachers who nurtured my love for reading. I was fortunate to be able to eat a subsidized hot lunch at school every day, a big financial and time-saving help to my family since both of my parents worked full-time. As a kid, I spent most weekends holed up at the local public library reading books – where I got to absorb new ideas and adventure through unfamiliar worlds. I went to college with the help of federal student aid, allowing me the chance to fund my education through grants and work study jobs. As a teenager, I watched my parents struggle for years to navigate the green card application process for permanent residency – when I turned 18 years old, I wasted no time in becoming naturalized as a U.S. citizen.</p>

<p>Throughout my life, I was gifted with so many opportunities by growing up in this country. However, I also keenly felt how difficult it was to navigate many of those systems –&nbsp; like the obstacles my parents faced (navigating language barriers, immigration issues, and digital literacy gaps) to be able to build a home here in America.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m grateful for the public welfare programs that reflect our society’s commitment to taking care of all of its citizens. I’m also determined to continue to improve the gaps that still exist in these programs through my skills in technology, data, and policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Working with passionate public servants across California state government is the opportunity of a lifetime to continue my work of bringing innovation to government policies and programs and serving people like my parents who have always quietly worked in the background to find better lives in this country.</p>

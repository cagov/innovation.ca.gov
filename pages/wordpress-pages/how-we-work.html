<p>The Office of Digital Innovation (ODI) creates lasting change in state government. Our combination of user research and human-centered design improves services for all Californians.</p>

<h2>Start with problems, not solutions</h2>

<p>Too often teams assume what the solution is before they understand the problem. This results in temporary fixes that often fail to meet people’s needs.</p>

<p>ODI begins with the problem before thinking about solutions. We use our expertise in user research and first-party data to discover core problems. We bring people–including their attitudes, behaviors, and needs–into service design and delivery. These are the opportunities for innovation that transform state government.</p>

<p>We start with discovery sprints where we go deep to better understand the problem. We assemble diverse, cross-disciplinary teams that look at&nbsp; services from many angles. We use user research, data, analytics, and insights to uncover foundational insights about services. We design and prototype solutions, using data and insights to inform and measure progress. And we hand off to clients, ensuring they have capacity and expertise to scale and continue iterating on the solutions we’ve created together.</p>

<h2>Experiment, learn, and iterate</h2>

<p>We embrace experimentation in every aspect of our work.</p>

<p>We continuously question and test our work. Our analytics team gathers data to measure outcomes. These data becomes insights that we use to iterate on our work and begin the cycle again.</p>

<h2>Work in the open</h2>

<p>Our engineers and designers make our code available publicly through GitHub. Sharing our work invites dialogue with other teams and the public. Being open also helps build confidence and trust in state government as a whole.</p>

<p>We also believe that telling the story of the why, what, and how of our work is essential. When we share our journey, other teams can draw on our work to solve similar problems.</p>

<h2>Create sustainable solutions</h2>

<p>Building up others is a central part of ODI. We make sure our partners can carry projects forward on their own. When we hand off to clients, we ensure they have capacity and expertise to scale and continue iterating on the solutions we created together. This includes training them on best practices and how to continually innovate.</p>

<p>Procuring digital services in state government can be difficult. We partner with departments to improve how the state buys digital services and tools.</p>

<p>Hiring design, engineering, research, and data professionals into the public sector is hard. ODI models how to bring best-practice roles found in the private sector into state government.</p>

<h2>Our values</h2>

<p>We regularly reflect on what works (and what does not). ODI has identified key values that guide us in everything we do.</p>

<h3>Put the needs of Californians first</h3>

<p>Our role is to listen to Californians and understand what they need. This lets us include their experiences and concerns in service design. This is the only way we can create the services that help people.</p>

<h3>Design with, not for</h3>

<p>The best services are created with the involvement of the people they serve. We involve Californians and departments in the design process from start to finish.</p>

<h3>Empathy</h3>

<p>Understanding Californians’ problems is not enough. We bring empathy to our work by remembering that what we do affects the lives of people. We never assume that we know what people need.</p>

<h3>Equity</h3>

<p>Innovation happens when you design for people on the margins. ODI looks for opportunities to improve historically-underserved communities’ access to state services.</p>

<h3>Culture of learning</h3>

<p>Innovation is not something that happens once. It is a cycle that always challenges us to do better. We experiment with new techniques and tools to find ways to better serve Californians.</p>

<h3>Measure with data</h3>

<p>What we can measure, we can improve. We ground our work in data to guide our decisions and know if we’re making a difference.</p>

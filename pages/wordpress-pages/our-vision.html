<p>The needs and concerns of Californians are the heart and soul of our work. By putting people first, we avoid assuming what the best solution is. Instead, we design in response to people’s experiences, involving them in our process.</p>

<p>We’re transforming how the State of California works. When we partner with departments, we build a culture of innovation by:</p>

<h2>About CalData</h2>

<p>The mission of the Office of the Chief Data Officer, known as CalData, is to empower use of data by ensuring the state has the infrastructure, processes, and people to manage, access, and use data efficiently, effectively, securely, and responsibly. By acting on our mission, we will realize our vision of better decisions, services, and outcomes for Californians through better use of data. Our goals and supporting strategic objectives are structured around the analogy that in order to successfully navigate the “data landscape” we need to intentionally build the roads, craft the rules of the road, and boost the travelers. Much like in the real world, we want to avoid data roads that lead to nowhere, are poorly maintained, or confuse our travelers. Our virtual data world requires the planning and care that we put into the roads and bridges of the real world.</p>

<p>Effective July 1, 2022, CalData is now part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://innovation.ca.gov/who-we-are/caldata/">Office of Data and Innovation</a>.

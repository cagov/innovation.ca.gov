<p class="cagov-emphasized">The Digital Innovation Fund (DIF) is a path to partnership between your department and the Office of Digital Innovation (ODI).</p>

<p>Together, we will use human-centered design to identify problems and fund solutions that improve services for all Californians.</p>

<h2>What makes a good DIF candidate</h2>

<p>ODI looks for four qualities when reviewing DIF applications. </p>

<h3>1. Your service needs improvement</h3>

<p>You have an awareness and curiosity about what’s not working now. You’re focused on desired outcomes and not solutions. You see opportunities to improve outcomes for Californians.</p>

<h3>2. You&#8217;re excited to collaborate</h3>

<p>You see yourselves as co-designers of the service. Your team is willing to participate and collaborate with ODI to guarantee success that lasts.</p>

<h3>3. You&#8217;re open to new solutions</h3>

<p>You’re ready to discover, innovate, and experiment. You learn from failures to springboard to success. You’re flexible and willing to adopt new processes and technologies.</p>

<h3>4. You&#8217;re committed to putting users first</h3>

<p>You prioritize the needs of the end user over all else. You’re guided by user feedback and research. You want to remove the struggle from using the service.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Pilot partners</h2>

<p>We’re collaborating with these partners for the first phase of DIF projects:</p>

<p><br><strong>About the team:</strong> The mission of the Office of the Chief Data Officer, known as CalData, is to empower use of data by ensuring the state has the infrastructure, processes, and people to manage, access, and use data efficiently, effectively, securely, and responsibly. By acting on our mission, we will realize our vision of better decisions, services, and outcomes for Californians through better use of data. Our goals and supporting strategic objectives are structured around the analogy that in order to successfully navigate the “data landscape” we need to intentionally build the roads, craft the rules of the road, and boost the travelers. Much like in the real world, we want to avoid data roads that lead to nowhere, are poorly maintained, or confuse our travelers. Our virtual data world requires the planning and care that we put into the roads and bridges of the real world.</p>

<p><strong>About the role:</strong> CalData’s policy and programs team focuses on statewide policies and programs that directly impact the effectiveness of data teams across the state, including topics such as ethical AI use, data ethics, demographic data standards, equitable metric definition, and analysis best practices.</p>

<p>As the Data &amp; Analytics Governance Lead, you will lead major initiatives to develop and shape new data &amp; analytics policies and standards and supporting guidance via an iterative and inclusive process. This role will live at the nexus of policy and practice. You will be a crucial steward of that nexus, collaborating and drawing on the experience of the CalData Data Services team, Advanced Analytics &amp; Evaluation team, and subject matter experts across the state as well as groups outside the state. You will also collaborate with state data teams via CalData’s analytics accelerators to streamline implementation and ensure the policy or standard meets the needs of the data teams.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview</h2>

<p>The Office of Data and Innovation (ODI) was established on July 1, 2019, as an office within the Government Operations Agency (GovOps) and became a standalone department on July 1, 2023. This year’s legislative report showcases the progress made during the 2023-24 fiscal year (FY).</p>

<p>ODI’s mission and vision statement are:&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>MISSION: “We drive innovation across California state government, using data, technology, and human-centered design to achieve exceptional, equitable outcomes for all Californians. We collaborate with leaders and communities throughout California and the world. We partner to build empathy for the people we serve and create a government that is easy to interact with and solves big problems.”</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>VISION: “A state government that is modern, effective, and provides exceptional service to all Californians.”&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>From its creation, the department prioritized building strong relationships across state government and leveraged these partnerships to improve services to Californians. In FY 2023-24, ODI launched initiatives that allowed for transformational work through training, human-centered design, service innovation, and data analysis with the purpose of improving service delivery for all Californians. The department houses a multi-disciplinary staff with expertise in engineering, user research, analytics, content design, training, talent, engagement, and communications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To fulfill the department’s mission, ODI established a set of strategic goals:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Develop a statewide culture of innovation that drives efficiency and improves customer experience.</li>

<li>Establish statewide standards to transform service delivery, increase government efficiency, and improve outcomes.</li>

<li>Enable departments to adopt the tools and practices that support continuous improvement and performance measurement.</li>
</ul>

<p>ODI is positioned to lead statewide initiatives in partnership with GovOps, the Governor’s Office, and state departments to collaborate on scalable solutions to improve delivery of vital state services. ODI partners with departments to improve their service delivery by introducing modern tools and training them in the skills necessary for innovation. This innovation leads to streamlined processes and drives government efficiency, resulting in a better customer experience for those the state serves. ODI sets statewide standards for data use and service delivery to minimize risk and increase product success to ensure solutions effectively meet Californian’s needs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Activities of the Office Fiscal Year 2023-24</h2>

<p>ODI’s activities during this FY fall into two main categories: statewide strategic initiatives and projects with partner departments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our statewide strategic initiatives are cross-departmental efforts that require collaboration between multiple state entities. This work is ODI’s opportunity to drive government transformation at scale through our work helping state government entities improve their service delivery by embedding a human-centered approach in statewide standards, policy, programs, and digital services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also partner directly with departments to perform problem definition, discovery, user research, prototyping, and piloting of innovative solutions to address customer issues in their service delivery process. These projects are funded by the Data and Innovation Services Revolving Fund (DISRF), known as the Data and Innovation Fund (DIF).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Statewide Strategic Initiatives</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Implementing the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GENAI) Executive Order&nbsp;</h3>

<p>In September 2023, Governor Gavin Newsom issued Executive Order EO N-12-23 (GenAI EO) requesting multiple departments across the state to author a first-of-its-kind benefits and risks analysis on GenAI use in state government.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ODI was a key contributor to the <em>Benefits and Risks of the Generative Artificial Intelligence Report</em> published November 2023, alongside GovOps, the California Department of Technology (CDT), the Department of General Services (DGS), and the Governor&#8217;s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz). This team of departments researched and reported on the beneficial use cases and potential risks of GenAI. ODI expertise played a key role in both the community engagement efforts, as well as the research and drafting of this historic report. The GenAI EO and its directives showcased California’s leadership in technological advances, positioned the state as pioneers in innovation, and established guardrails and engagement needed before any consideration or use of GenAI by state government entities.</p>

<p>Additionally, as part of the GenAI EO, ODI was individually responsible for making a human-centered toolkit to enable state teams to operationalize the new processes to procure GenAI. ODI developed and implemented product management principles in the creation of GenAI Proofs of Concept (POC), and to ensure business and user value is both delivered and considered in the overall evaluation prior to a potential procurement.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Developing Data and Service Delivery Standards</h3>

<p>Due to ODI’s expertise in human-centered design and data, our office was specifically tasked in Governor Newsom’s Executive Order N-16-22 (EO)<strong> </strong>with developing statewide standards for collecting race, ethnicity, and other demographic data and for developing a set of service delivery standards to identify gaps and improve reach of programs and services to eligible Californians, among other actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Delivering these data standards and service delivery recommendations for the EO will help improve equity across the state. Adopting these best practices enables improved access for Californians to state services and promotes consistent data practices across state agencies and departments for greater efficiency and collaboration.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Demographic Data Standards</h4>

<p>ODI’s work in this critical area began in FY 2022-23 and continued in FY 2023-24, with a focus on alignment with the federal data standard, user research, community engagement, and user testing efforts to refine the standards to better serve California’s diverse population.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Race and Ethnicity Data Standard</h4>

<p>ODI developed recommendations for a data standard on race and ethnicity data collection and analysis. The standard aims to ensure consistent practices across state departments and support the development of metrics and programs. ODI&#8217;s recommendations incorporate best practices and critical stakeholder engagement, while addressing California&#8217;s unique diversity and privacy considerations. To gather feedback, ODI partnered with GovOps to conduct community roundtables, consultations, and interviews with academic experts.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Plain Language Standard</h4>

<p>In FY 2022-23, ODI recommended use of plain language as the foundation for successful communication and service delivery to Californians, and recommended that state entities use an 8th grade reading level or below as a base for the written communications. ODI identified that plain language:&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Increases access and usability for all Californians, across literacy levels and for different languages.</li>

<li>Works better with screen readers.</li>

<li>Respects the mental and emotional state of those seeking services during a time of crisis.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In FY 2022-23</strong> ODI’s work on the plain language standard included:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Creating an Innovation Hub with resources on human-centered design and guidance for state entities to implement plain language in their communications&nbsp; to support broader state adoption of this plain language standard.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Launching a Plain Language course as a first initiative for this effort. This course is offered free of charge to all state employees on the California Department of Human Resources (CalHR’s) Learning Management System (CalLearns) training platform. The course provides hands-on practice in applying the principles of ODI&#8217;s plain language standard.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In FY 2023-24</strong> ODI’s work included:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Hosting the <em>Introduction to Plain Language for the Public Sector</em> on CalLearns. This interactive training program provides a guide to plain language writing for the public sector, prioritizing readers&#8217; needs and Californians’ access to information. It also allows time to practice writing in plain language to apply learnings quickly, and supports state entities meeting the requirements of EO N-16-22.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>This course began with a live course to allow ODI to test different training methods and refine the content.&nbsp;</li>

<li>By the end of FY 2023-24, the training had a completion rate of more than 91% <em>, </em>and 486 state staff and leadership had taken the <em>Introduction to plain language for the public sector</em> training.</li>

<li>Training participants have shared strong positive feedback in relation to the value of the information learned through the training.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Hosting 4 executive level webinars on “plain language” inviting all directors and deputies in state service to participate.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Executive webinars had a total attendance of 732 state leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Executive webinars were hosted by ODI’s Director Jeffery Marino and the State Chief Equity Officer Pam Chueh.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Data and Innovation Fund (DIF) Partner Projects</h2>

<p>ODI is legislatively mandated to lead innovation and statewide transformation in service delivery. The DIF was funded to foster collaboration between ODI and state agencies, allowing for innovative solutions that improve services to Californians. DIF-funded engagements are unique because of their people, process, innovation, and data-focused problem statements. ODI builds pilots, tools, and resources for state agencies and departments partnering with ODI through the DIF</p>

<p>ODI launched the first DIF project solicitation in June 2022. These projects have improved state government service delivery for Californians’ through service innovation, increased social safety net program uptake, and improved access to historically underrepresented Californians. Additionally, these projects have also reduced data errors, increased state departments ability to mitigate potential service delivery challenges, reduced fraud, and expanded access to social benefits. By leveraging technology, data analytics, user research and human center design, ODI is transforming how the state government delivers services to the people of California.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How the Data and Innovation Fund Works</h3>

<p>Applications to the DIF require a competitive process reviewed by an impartial Advisory Committee, and final selection by a Selection Committee. The DIF Selection Committee prioritizes projects with the greatest potential return on investment, and the potential to scale across departments to accelerate innovation in the state.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Services Offered through the Data and Innovation Fund</h3>

<p>ODI’s program staff are experts in many disciplines. Through a series of pre-application webinars and office hours, ODI educates potential DIF partner applicants about the services ODI offers and which may be best suited to their unique problem(s). ODI services include:</p>
